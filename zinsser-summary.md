# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Steven Melena

In chapter 2 Zinsser is explaining that the way people create sentences 
is too complicated and that there seems to be a problem with just making 
short, straight forward sentences. Sentences should not contain any complicated
words that are not needed and should only contain the bare minimum, and 
every sentence you write should be simplified as much as possible.

In chapter 3 Zinsser is explaining how people currently add too many prepositions
which complicates the sentence, verb, or adjective with too much fluff that has the
same meaning. Language is attempting to become more professional by doing this, however
it is complicating simple phrases by changing them into more complicated ones, such as
his example with "Are you experiencing any pain?" instead of asking "Does this hurt?."
Zinsser is showing that instead of people being straight forward with their language, they
are complicating it in order to make it sound professional, proper, sophisticated, but it is 
doing the opposite.
